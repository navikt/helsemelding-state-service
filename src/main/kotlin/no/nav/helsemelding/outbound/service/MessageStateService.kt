     * persisted atomically.

    /**
     * Returns messages that are candidates for polling against the external system.
     *
     * A message is considered *pollable* when:
     *
     * 1. Its external delivery state indicates that the external processing is still in progress:
     *    - `externalDeliveryState` is `null` (initial NEW state), or
     *    - `externalDeliveryState` is `ACKNOWLEDGED` or `UNCONFIRMED` (PENDING states).
     *
     * 2. No application-level receipt has been recorded yet (`appRecStatus` is `null`).
     *    This ensures that messages in terminal states such as `COMPLETED` or `REJECTED`
     *    are **never** polled again.
     *
     * 3. The message has either never been polled before (`lastPolledAt` is `null`),
     *    or it was last polled sufficiently long ago, as defined by
     *    [PollerConfig.minAgeSeconds]. This prevents repeatedly hammering the same
     *    in-progress messages.
     *
     * The query is additionally restricted by [PollerConfig.fetchLimit], which defines
     * the maximum number of messages returned in a single polling cycle. This bound
     * controls database load and provides predictable throughput when many messages
     * are in an in-progress state.
     *
     * Note that `fetchLimit` only determines how many messages are *fetched* from the
     * database. Polling and write-back are performed in smaller logical units based on
     * [PollerConfig.batchSize], which controls how many messages are processed and
     * marked as polled at a time. This allows tuning of external load (e.g., NHN)
     * independently of database fetch size.
     *
     * Default configuration values:
     * - `minAgeSeconds`: 30 seconds — minimum age since last poll.
     * - `fetchLimit`: 200 messages — maximum number fetched per cycle.
     * - `batchSize`: 25 messages — number processed per batch.
     *
     * These defaults can be overridden through application configuration or environment variables.
     *
     * @return a list of messages that are eligible for polling based on external state and timing.
